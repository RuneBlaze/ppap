<style>
1. Do not preserve backward compatibility when making API changes.
2. Delete unused code; don't comment them out.
</style>

<general>
1. We have both `remeda` and `ts-pattern` as utility libraries. Prefer them if offering a readability advantage.
2. This is a Phaser 3, retro-style game (HD pixel art).
3. All positioning uses integer coordinates for pixel-perfect rendering.
4. ALWAYS use `src/palette.ts` for colors. Anything outside the palette is strongly discouraged.
5. Prefer absolute imports (e.g., `@/ui/layout/Container`) over relative imports.

## Project Overview
- **Game Type:** Retro-style card game with a dual-loop system: fast-paced roguelite dungeon crawling ("Front Office") and a slower, strategic political simulation ("Back Office").
- **Technology Stack:** TypeScript, Phaser 3, Vite.
- **Aesthetics:** Pixel art, HD-2D, Godot-inspired UI effects (3D hover, smooth transitions, advanced visual effects). Think "what would RPG Maker VX do".
- **Core Gameplay:** Turn-based combat, card-based mechanics, narrative-driven political simulation with character "cards" moving on a grid.

## UI Architecture & Design Principles
- **Composition over Inheritance:** Build complex UIs from simple primitives.
- **Declarative Configuration:** Use JSON-like configs for UI layouts.
- **Reactive State:** UI should automatically update when state changes.
- **Pixel-Perfect:** Integer positioning, palette-constrained colors.
- **Keyboard-First:** Arrow keys, Enter/Escape, Tab navigation as primary interaction.
- **Component-Based:** UI elements, game entities, and systems should be self-contained modules with clear, well-defined APIs.
- **Formalize State:** Use State Machines (FSMs) for complex, long-lived state (e.g., character states, scene transitions, UI interactions).
- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** For any given piece of state, there must be exactly one authoritative source.

## Coding Philosophy
- **Functional Core, Imperative Shell:** Core game logic should be pure, stateless functions. The "shell" handles side effects and interacts with Phaser/DOM.
- **Data-Oriented Design:** Game data (stats, definitions, layouts) must be separate from logic. Avoid hardcoding data in scene files.
- **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Write simple, direct, and easy-to-understand code.
- **Decouple from Framework:** Core logic should not depend on Phaser for portability and testability.
- **Make Debugging a Feature:** Treat debugging tools as core features (on-screen state, visualizations).
- **Measure, Don't Guess:** Avoid premature optimization; use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
- **Guided, Ruthless Refactoring:** Continuously eliminate duplication and improve code quality, guided by architectural principles.
